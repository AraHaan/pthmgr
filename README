This is a DLL for Windows that exports a class and a number of functions that
provide easy access to environment variables. This includes reading, writing,
creating, and deleting variables.

These functions modify the non-volatile environment variables that are stored
in the system registry.

See the editenv.h and EnvVar.hpp header files for API documentation.
